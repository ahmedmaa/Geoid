# Geoid Software
This software is used for the determination of high-frequency geoid model from the terrestrial gravity data. 
With this software you can use the following kernels:\
 1- Original Stokes\
 2- Wong and Gore (WG)\
 3- VK (Vanicek-Kleusberg)\
 4- LS biased\
 5- LS unbiased\
 6- LS Optimum\
For the kernels (1-3) you can apply the remove computer restore (RCR) method as you as you can use some additional programs for a full geoid determination scheme.\
This software is guided by a built-in example and a (3x3) testing gravity grid you. The prompt of the code will ask you to enter the file names and parameters of the example.\
The modification parameters are provided in prn files for VK and LS methods.\
